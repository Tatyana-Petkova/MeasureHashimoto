Introduction
------------

MeasureHashimoto is an exam project. Its main purpose is to collect blood test results of specific hormones of the Thyroid gland and analyse them. The main goal is to notify the user if some of the results are out of the optimal range or even out of the reference range of the laboratory. Currently it works with the reference range of only one specific laboratory and only alerts the user with red and yellow color if the results are out of range. In future the app should have visual representation of the results with line charts and it should work with reference range set by the user.
